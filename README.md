# cve-filtering-tool
A python script to filter the CVEs. Different parameters for the API are being used to filter the CVEs based on the severity, date range, CWE associated with it, etc.

The script can be customised to change the filters and get desired CVEs.
Currently, the script is filtering out the CVEs with Critical and High CVEs and also CVEs that are Critical or High, but also have no privilege required and no user interaction for exploitation, between the specified data range.
